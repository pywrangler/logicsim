# logicsim
A combinatorial circuit simulation engine.
Note: When I came up with the name logicsim there were already hundreds of other repos on github with the same name but I only came to realise this much later and it was way too late to change the name.So be aware that this is not a fork of any other repository.

The idea was to create a circuit simulator engine with high level abstractions for a circuit simulator app on android.
logicsim implements logic gates such as AND,OR,NOT,XOR,OR,XNOR,NAND. These gates can be connected with each other and the truth table generated automatically for each and every combination of inputs (1's and 0's).  Circuits such as half adder,full adder,subtractor,multiplexers,demultiplexers can be built and tested.

To allow users to test the engine before building an UI, a console interface is also present.The tutorial below teaches you how to build a half adder circuit.
